            Such is the mental discipline of the Grey Knights that even the lowest of their rank can wield the energies of the warp as a weapon. In the midst of a clangorous firefight a battle-brother can shut out all external stimulus, ignoring pain and fear to focus his mind into a reaping blade for the Emperor. By attuning his mind with those of his fellow battle-brothers, a single Grey Knight can bolster his reserve of mental energy and bring his psychic might to bear repeatedly against the enemy or in aid of his allies.

Adeptus Astartes – Strategic Ploy Stratagem

At the most critical time, Reivers engage their armour's enhanced features to terrify and disrupt the enemy as much as possible.
Use this Stratagem in your Command phase. Select one REIVER unit from your army.

    That unit gains the following ability: 'Terror Troops (Aura): Until the start of your next Command phase, while an enemy unit is within 3" of that unit, it loses the Objective Secured ability and any similar abilities that allow them to control an objective marker regardless of the number of enemy models within range of that objective marker.
    Until the end of the turn, each time that REIVER unit ends a Normal Move, an Advance or a charge move within 3" of an enemy unit that is performing an action, roll 2D6: if the total exceeds that enemy unit's Leadership characteristic, the action the unit is attempting to perform immediately fails.
